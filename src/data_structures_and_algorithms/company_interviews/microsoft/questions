a) Write a function which simply returns 0X00000000 if input value is 0 else 0XFFFFFFFF. Condition is no branching , no looping and no ternary operators.
Solutions

    int bit(int n)
    {
    return (!n + (n|~n));
    }


b) Infinite bit stream is coming (one bit at a time). At a given time tell whether number is divisible by 3 or not
Solution:

     sum=0;
    while(bit stream is coming)
    {
    sum=sum<<1+1*(current bit);
    if(sum%3==0)
    printf(�divisible\n�);
    else
    printf(�not divisible�);
    }


c) Check whether a given string consists the substring of type �ab*c�
Solution:

      char *str=INPUT STRING
    int i=0,flag=0;
    while(str[i])
    {
    if(str[i++]==�a�)
    {
    while(str[i]==�b�)
    i++;
    if(str[i++]==�c�)
    {
    printf(�substring found�);
    flag=1;
    break;
    }
    }
    }
    if(!flag)
    printf(�substring not found�);



1. Given a BST and 2 numbers a,b. Find the number of hops to reach from a to b.

2. Given a set of unsorted numbers without a range, find the median. No sort operations should be used. Solution should be of the order n log n.

3. Given 2 sorted arrays on size n, find the median of both of them are merged.

4. Big integer multiplication,

5. counting of palindromes within a string,

6. identifying the possibility to sort a partially sorted linked list with a single swap,

7. Hanoi towers,

8. finding Top K elements of an array

9. Given an array of integers, find all the 3 numbers that sum up to a target number? (Variants asked by 3 different companies)

10. Given a word which can have wild card characters and a dictionary, find if the word is valid? (Catch is to do in O(1), Variants asked by 2 different companies), "d*g" is valid with dict: {dog, god,foo}

11. Find all the combinations of size k of a word which are also palindromes? (Again variants asked by 2 companies)
